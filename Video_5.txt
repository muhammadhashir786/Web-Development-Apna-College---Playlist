There are multiple webpages in a website
webpages are different to each other but sab m 1 similar pattern hota hai us k hisaab se html m 1 structure hota hai or ye hamare code ko kaafi readable banata hai agr ham is structure m code krenge to lets see how's this structure?

The upper part of a website is called Header 
there is a strip in every website it includes navigations and links, headings, logo, name and intro of the website 
and if we visit another webpage of that website so mostly header remains the same 
so in this section of website jo bhi elements aienge unko header tag k ander likhenge

all the contents that are present in the upper part of the website put in the header tag 

there is a navigation bar in which menu buttons, links or tabs
it is like similar to header and consisitent in all the webpages or isme ham content wrap krne k lye nav tag ka use krenge 

some peoples also put navigation under the header tag, there is no problem

now there is main tag, this is the main center area of the webpage 
we put the main content of our webpage in main tag 

there are sections in main tag jis k lye section tag use krte hn   
we keep single peace of functionality means we type some peace of content and does not repeat them like testimonial, contact us section etc.  

there is an article tag in section jis k ander blog ya post type ki cheezen aati hn 

then there is a side bar in the webpage that includes quotes, adds or youtube video in the sidebar, 
so this sidebar put in the aside tag 

there is a footer tag in html looks like a strip and same in all webpages that includes the last part of the webpage in which faq, copyright, author, contact info are includes

these are semantic Tags

Semantic Tags:

vo tags jo browser or developer dono k lye kuch meaning rakhte hon 

heading tags
nav Tags


Non-Semantic Tags:

the tags that do not have any meaning in html document 

div tag     (block element) 
span tag    (inline element)

Inline Elements:

vo elements that takes only those space in the webpage that it requires 

Block Elements:

the elements that takes horizontally complete width in the webpage that it does not require are block Elements

code:

    <p>this is first para</p>
    <p>this is first second para</p>
    <p>this is first third para</p>
    <em>this is emphasized tag</em>
    <em>and this is inline element</em>
