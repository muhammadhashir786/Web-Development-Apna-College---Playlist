Define html.

first we learn abcd in English, same as in web dev the first thing is to learn html
html is like abcd of any website 
because any website does not exist without html
HTML stands for hypertext markup language
jesa k name se pta chal rha hai k html koi programming language nhi hai balke markup language hai

What is markup language?

1 aesi language jisme ham kuch tags ki help se browser ko instructions dete hn ya btate hn or phir browser usko smajh k ksi bhi webpage ko display krta hai

html is a very simple language
html is made up of many elements

OR

What does html consists into?

html consists into 3 main parts:

Tags 
Elements
Attributes

Overview of tags, elements and attributes:

there are some tags in html
html is made up of many different tags
and elements are made up of these tags
elements are the individual components of any html document
and every elements have its own meaning

2 Types of Tags in HTML:

opening tag     (start tag)
closing tag     (end tag)

Note:   hover any html tag to know more about that tag

Generally there are 2 types of tags in html but there are 1 more tag in html which is called Empty Tag

Empty Tag:

An html tag that does not have a closing tag is called Empty tag

Examples:   <br>, <hr>, <img> etc 

Syntax of Tags:

    <opening tagName>       </closing tagName>

Example of Tags:

Code: 

    <p> </p>     (this is paragraph tag)

Element:

there is some content in between opening and closing tag
then the combination of opening tag, some content and closing tag is called element
Everything from the start tag to the end tag is element

Syntax of Element:

<opening tagName> some content </closing tagName>

Example of Element:

Code: 

    <p> this is some content </p>     (this is paragraph tag)

but there are some elements, that does not have any content and closing tag like <img>, <br> and <hr> tags, etc

code:

    <img src="image.jpg"> 

image element ka content text m nhi hota hai, to isme ham image file ki location dete hn src attribute k ander, 
or us k lye ham sirf opening tag ka use krte hn or isi lye closing tag ka use nhi hota hai

Nesting of Elements:

Elements inside element is called Nesting of elements.
ksi bhi element k ander doosra element use krna Nesting of elements kehlata hai 
we can do nesting of elements many times
we can keep many elements in a single element

Example of Nesting of Elements:

<body>
    <h1> this is heading tag </h1>
    <p> this is paragraph tag </p>
</body>

we can also give boiler plate code or html basic page structure as an Example of nesting of elements 

or is se ham elements ki properties ko mix kr sakte hn 
or uski wja se poora document ka structure banta hai
lekin agr ham html m sirf elements ka hi use kren, to html document 1 word ya google doc jesa document lagega, jisme sirf kuch text formatting ho rakhi hn.
to html m ham use krte hn attributes jo un elements k ander jaan daal deta hai. 

So these are Elements in HTML 

What are Attributes?

we give some additional properties to every elements
like in the image element we use height and width attributes to increase the length and breadth of image
we define attributes in the starting tag of any element

Syntax of attributes:

Code: 

    <startingTag attributeName = "attributeValue">

Example of attributes:

if we use paragraph tag, we can define align attribute in it to align paragraph in center:

Code: 

    <p align="center"> this is some content </p>

3 Types of Attributes:

i. Required attributes
ii. Boolean attributes
iii. General Purpose attributes

Required Attributes:

There are some tags in html in which some specific attributes are required like src attribute in image tag

1st example:

Code: 

    <img src="location.jpg"> 

there is no content in the image tag,
we can define the location of image in the src attribute of image element 
so that's why src attribute is required in image tag, otherwise image tag does not work

These are the Required Attributes in html

Boolean Attributes:

There are some attributes in html that do not have any value like below:

Code: 

    <input type="text" disabled>

is se koi bhi element disable ho jata hai or ham isko baad me use nhi kr sakte

Code:

    <input type="text" required>

whenever we fill any form and we did not type our name in the name section and try to submit form
then it does not submit, it will show you name is required in this form to submit it.

These are the Boolean Attributes in html

General Purpose Attributes:

There are some attributes in html that we used so much in web development, these are called General purpose attributes.
we can use general purpose attributes in any element of html 
or ye aese attributes hn jo ham ksi bhi element m use kr sakte hn

Some General Purpose Attributes are:

i.  id 
ii. class

id Attribute:

id attribute is the unique name of an element
we give a unique name to any element using id attribute 

ham id attribute ki value kuch bhi rakh sakte hn but poore document m unique honi chahye matlab vo same value ksi doosre id attribute ki nhi honi chahye

you will think every element already have its own name, so why will we give another unique name to any element?

hamne yahan element ko 1 unique name diya hai jo k poore html document m sirf 1 element ka hi hai,
ham 1 element ko 1 hi id de sakte,
or us se ham sirf us 1 particular element ko target kr sakte hn or use kr sakte hn
agr hamare html document me bht saare elements hn or ham unme se ksi 1 element ko target krna chahte hn to ham id attribute ki madad se kr sakte hn 

Example of id attribute:

if we have 2 paragraphs in a webpage
and we want to give different colors to both paragraph.
then we give unique id to both paragraph elements

Code:

    <p id="first"> This is first paragraph with some content </p>       (1st paragraph)
    <p id="second"> This is second paragraph with some content </p>     (2nd paragraph)

use CSS:

Code:

#first {
    color: blue;            (for 1st paragraph)
}

#second {
    color: red;             (for 2nd paragraph)
}

class attribute:

class attribute is the non-unique name of an element
class attribute is similar to id but opposite to id attribute, bas yahan vo unique nhi hota, same name hota hai 
we give the same name to multiple elements using class attribute
ham 1 se ziada elements ko same class de sakte hn
or is se ham un tamam elements ko 1 class ki help se target kr sakte hn

ham class attribute ki value kuch bhi rakh sakte hn or 1 se ziada elements ko same class de sakte hn matlab vo same value ksi doosre class attribute ko de sakte hn 

we can also use the value of id attribute in the value of class attribute 
but we can not use the value of id attribute in other id attribute

Example of class attribute:

if we have 2 paragraphs in a webpage
and we want to give same colors to both paragraphs
then we give same class to both paragraph elements

there are 2 methods to give same colors to both paragraphs:

give a unique id to both elements
give a same class to both elements

Not recommended:

if we give id to both paragraphs then hamara kaam kafi barh jaiega or ham 1 id se 1 hi element ko control kr sakte hn, agr hamare pas bh saare elements hn to hamen sab ko alag alag unique id deni hogi or bht lamba process hojaiega 

Recommended:

but if we give class to both paragraphs then hamara kaam asaan hojaiega or ham 1 class ki madad se bht saare elements ko control kr sakte hn 

Code:

    <p class="first"> This is first paragraph with some content </p>
    <p class="first"> This is second paragraph with some content </p>

So these are the General Purpose Attributes in HTML

Now we will see the basic structure of an HTML document

What is the basic structure of an html document?
How to create structure of a website?










HTML page structure:

let's see how an html document will be created using these elemnts and attributes?

ksi bhi individual element se 1 poora webapge nhi banta hai
us k lye ham alag alag elements ko use kr k 1 poora basic structure banate hn 
jisko boiler plate code kehte hn, or phir alag alag elements se mil kar 1 webpage banta hai 

First Tag of HTML Document:

we use the first tag in html to create the structure of document is doctype html tag:

syntax:

    <!DOCTYPE html>

by using this tag, we describe the browser that, what is the type of our document?
we give instructions to our browser that this is an html 5 document
because there are many type of documents like xml, html and xhtml etc. 
this means that this is an html document and the version of this document is 5 means "html 5"
it does not have a closing tag
this is the first tag of html document
it is placed at the top of html document at once

2nd Tag:

now the 2nd tag is html tag: 

syntax:

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html></html>

it is the root element of an html document in which our all the contents and elements is placed 

2 Main Tags in HTML Tag:

now there are 2 main tags in the html tag:

head tag
body tag

Head tag:

syntax:

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html> 
        <head></head>
    </html>

jo bhi information display nhi ho rhi hai lekin hamare webapge se related vo daalte hn head tag k ander
it contains meta data about an html docment
we give information about the webapge or an html document in head tag

what things will be included in head tag?

title of the webapge 
some meta tags for Seo 
link of favicon image, css and javascript files and some other external files 

Title tag:

there is a title tag in the head tag
title tag defines the title of the webpage
it is the name of a website/webpage
we give any name in the title that is related to our webpage
the title of an html document is displayed at the top of the webpage in the browser's tab 

syntax:

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html> 
        <head>
            <title>HTML Tutorial</title>
        </head>
    </html>    

Body Tag:

now the last tag of html document is body tag:

syntax:

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html> 
        <head>
            <title>HTML Tutorial</title>
        </head>
        <body></body>
    </html>  

this is the most important tag of html document 
because we write all the things and contents that will be display in our website

is it necessary to learn these things?

no! we can learn these things by just understand these things and practise many times in our computer

Setup Coding Environment:

For coding, we need to things to setup coding environment our computer:

1. install some tools 
2. create a project folder

1. Install Tools:

we need some tools or software to write code in html, these are:

Text Editor:

we will use text editor in starting (beginner level)
text editor is used to write some text
but we do not use word, we use notepad to write html code

Code Editor:

we will use code editor when we learn the basic of html (Basic level)
there are many code editors to write code but we use vs code for web dev 

Web Browser:

we need a browser to see the output of our code that is already installed on our computer like microsoft edge, chrome, firefox, opera, safari, etc
but we use google chrome browser

2. Create a Project Folder:

Second thing is to create a project folder on the desired location in our computer where we want to start our coding journey

why we create a project folder?

we need to create a project folder so that we can keep all the files in 1 place so that we can easily manage our files and this is the best practice for coding

How to create an HTML file?

After that open that project folder
create a notepad file in it
and enable the file extension option 
after that change the name of file to "index" and keep the extension ".html" means "index.html"

Beginner Level:     (coding in notepad)

now open index.html file
write the basic structure of html document in index.html file

Code:

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html> 
        <head>
            <title>HTML Tutorial</title>
        </head>
        <body></body>
    </html>  

after that in the body we type h1 tag and give a heading "Hello World" 
this heading will be displayed in the website

Code:

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html> 
        <head>
            <title>HTML Tutorial</title>
        </head>
        <body>
            <h1>Hello World</h1>
        </body>
    </html>  

after that save the index.html file
and check the output of this code 

How to check the output of html file?

double click on the index.html file 
it will open in the google chrome
you can see the output 

so this is how we can write code in html and check the output in google chrome

Basic Level:    (coding in vs code)

if we create a professional website using notepad then this process will be very time consuming we will waste our most important time 
so now we will use vs code to write codes for html or anyother programming language

why we use vs code instead of using notepad?

vs code is a special code editor that is open source and it provides us some features, shortcuts and basic functionalities which helps us to write code faster and easier and ham vs code ko use kr k apna bht saata time bacha sakte hn

Comparision of Code Editor VS Text Editor:

Code Editors gives:

shortcuts
auto recommendations
prettier code
indentation
beautiful themes

Normal Text Editor gives:

no shortcuts
no auto recommendations
ugly code
no indentation
no themes

How to open project folder in vs code?

if you don't have cs code first download and install vs code in windows 
after that go to project folder
right click on empty space on project folder 
click "open with code" option
then your project folder will be open in vs code
create an index.html file

what is index.html and why we create this file?

when we save our files in server, then jo hamari sab se pehli file hoti hai server m uska name index.html hota hai because jab bhi koi user hamare server ko locate krta hai to jese hi vo web address m hamara url enter krega to sab se pehli file jo open hoti hai vo index.html hoti hai 

afer that create a boiler plate code in this html file

what is Boiler Plate Code?

the basic structure of an html document is called Boiler Plate Code

How to generate boiler plate code?

we don't write boiler plate code itself in vs code
there are 2 shortcuts to create a boiler plate code in vs code

1st Method:     "!"

we just type Exclamation Mark "!" and press Enter
then a template of basic structure of an html document will generate automatically, this template is called the Boiler Plate Code

2nd Method:     "html:5"

Type html:5 and press Enter
then boiler plate code will generate 

this function is not available in notepad, this is why we use a code editor

so how is this possible?

this is possible through Emmet Abbreviation

What is Emmet Abbreviation?

Emmet Abbreviation is a tool or a plug-in that helps us to write code faster and easier 
you can learn more about Emmet in google

What are Extensions:

we need extensions to add some functionalities, themes, tools or other interesting things in vs code 
now install some best and helpful extensions from the Extensions Tab

Important Extensions:

live server:    to create a live server and see the output using it 
prettier:       to add indentation

What is indentation?

indentation means write code in neat & clean and organize manner and maintain a balanced descipline in all our the code or is se hamara code bht hi clear dikhta hai








Elements:

There are many elements in html but we learn the most important elements in html

Heading Tag:

if we give any type of heading in html document we use heading tags
it is a block element 

Syntax:

    <h1></h1>

6 Types of Headings:

there are 6 types of headings in html from h1 tag to h6 tags
h1 tag is the largest heading, h2 is smaller than h1, h3 is smaller than h2 and so on, and h6 is the smallest heading 
h1 is the meain heading of any webpage
h6 is the least important heading

Code:

    <body>
        <h1>this is h1 heading</h1>
        <h2>this is h2 heading</h2>
        <h3>this is h3 heading</h3>
        <h4>this is h4 heading</h4>
        <h5>this is h5 heading</h5>
        <h6>this is h6 heading</h6>
    </body>

Paragraph Tag:

Paragraph tag defines the normal text in html docment 
paragraph tag is used to display the normal text in a webpage 
it is a block element 

Syntax:

    <p></p>

Code:

    <body>
        <p>this is a normal text in a webapge using paragraph tag</p>
    </body>

Line Break Tag:

br tag is called line break tag 
line break tag defines a line break in html document
it is used to add line breaks in a webpage
it is a block element 

Syntax:

    <br>
    
Code:

    <body>
        <p>this is a normal text <br> in a webapge using <br> paragraph tag</p>
    </body>


Horizontal Ruler Tag:

hr tag is called horizontal rule/ruler tag
it defines a thematic change between the sections in html document 
hr tag is used to add a horizontal line or horizontal rule between the contents in webpage
it is a block element 

Syntax:

    <hr>
    
Code:

    <body>
        <p>this is a normal text in a webapge using paragraph tag</p>
        <hr>
    </body>

What are Whitespaces? 

if we write any normal text in our html document and we add multiple spaces or line breaks between them, then these extra spaces and line breaks will not display in our webapge, because our html document ignores extra spaces and line breaks and these extra spaces or line breaks are called White Spaces in html and our browser does not render whitespaces

How To Display Whitespaces: 

if we need to display whitespaces in the webpage so how can we do this?

we use HTML Entities to display whitespaces in webpage 

What are HTML Entities?

HTML Entities are the codes behind the reserved words & special characters 
these codes are used to display any reserved words & special characters in a webpage 
HTML tags are also included in reserved words because it contains "<", ">" and "/" and these are symbols or special characters

to display any reserved words or tags of html in a webapge, we use html entities of that reseved words or characters in html document

What are Reserved Words?

there are some words or characters in html that we can not display them in a webpage by normal written form, to display these characters in webpage we use HTML Entities.

What things are included in reserved words?

    HTML keywords
    Symbols
    Special characters
    Emojis
    Display Any Tags

Every reserved characters have entity in the form of string, number and hexa decimal, etc.
it is recommended to use string entity because it is easy 

Syntax:

    &entity_name;          (recommended)
    &#entity_number;  

How To Display Reserved Words:

if we want to display the <h1></h1> tag or any white space so how can we display them?
if we write h1 in a normal way like we give heading in html document so our browser understand that this is h1  heading tag in which some text will be written, and h1 is not a simple text, our browser does not display h1 tag in the normal text form, it will display as the h1 heading in a webpage.
and if we add extra spaces in a normal way then our browser ignore that extra spaces because html ignores whitespaces, so how can we display whitespaces in html? 

we use html entity of whitespace to display extra spaces in a webpage

we can display any reserved characters, special characters, tags, emojis, symbols by using HTML Entities

normally our keyboard do not have all types of keys for all the symbols, emojis, special characters, so we can display them easily by using html entities of that characters.  

Where to find Entities?

You can see or find all the html entities in google 

How To Write Entities Of Any Reserved Words in HTML document?

copy the Entity string or number of any character and paste it in html document to display them in webpage

Example to display Heading Tag <h1></h1> in webpage:

What are the Entities in <h1></h1>?

in the <h1></h1> the reserved characters are:

    less than symbol "<" 
    h1 is a normal text
    greater than symbol ">" 
    forwardslash character "/" 

now find the entity of "<", ">" and "/" in google and paste it in html document

the entity of less than symbol "<" is:       &lt;
the entity of greater than symbol ">" is:    &gt;
the entity of forward slash "/" is:          &#47;

Code:

    <body>
        <p>&lt;h1&gt; &lt;&#47;h1&gt;</p> 
    </body>

Example to display Whitespaces in webpage:

Code:

    <body>
        <p>&lt;h1&gt; &lt;&#47;h1&gt;</p>         <!-- display heading tag h1 -->
        <p>this is &nbsp;&nbsp;some &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;content in webpage</p>    <!-- display whitespace -->
    </body>

Comments:

this is not our youtube, instagram or facebook Comments
there are comments in every programming languages, markup languages and stylesheet languages

comments are those lines of code that our browser does not render in the webpage 
comments do not display in the webpage
you can see the comments in your browser by view page source option 

Syntax: 

    <!--  -->

Representation:

    <!-- comments content goes here -->

Code: 

    <!-- <p> this is some content in webpage that is commented </p>

Why we write comments in our code?

comments ham apne asaani k lye likhte hn code me taa k ham baad me code ko smajh sake k yahan p kia code likha gya hai or kis lye likha gya hai

you can write comments in your code for your understanding when you read the code you know what is the code you write here and why and what is the section of code
we can also do comments to our code to save the code but not execute it

3 Types of Comments:

there are 3 types of comments in html:

    Inline comment
    Single-line comment
    Multi-line comment

Inline comment:

Comments start from any part of the line

place the cursor in any line from where you want your comments will start, and type 2 forward slashes "//". This is Inline comment

Shortcut of Comments:

press ctrl + /                                   (to comment the whole single line)
select multiple lines and press ctrl + /         (to comment multiple line at once) 

What is Lorem Epsum?

lorem epsum are the random words or texts that we generate if we needed some random texts or words in our webpage

To display any random words or texts in a webpage we can use "lorem epsum" under paragraph tag

Syntax:

    <p>lorem</p>

How to generate Random Text in webpage?

under the paragraph tag, type lorem and type any number with no space to lorem, then press enter  
then it will generate random words based on how many numbers you typed 

Representation:

    <p>lorem"n"</p>

where "n" denotes the number, means how many words you want to generate

if you want to generate 50 random words just type lorem50 and press enter, then 50 words will generate
to generate 300 random words, just type lorem300 and press enter, then 300 words will generate

Code:

    <p>lorem50</p>
    <p>lorem300</p>

include p tag under body tag for notes 

What happen if we only type lorem and press enter?

if we only type lorem and press enter then bydefault it will generate 30 words 

Code:

    <p>lorem</p>

Some Other Tags:

There are some other formatting tags that we learn below:

Bold Tag:

it defines bold tag 
it is used to make text Bold

Syntax:

    <b></b>

Code:

    <p>this is <b>some content</b> in my webpage</p>

Strong Tag:

it also defines bold tag with strong importance
it is used to show anything important in webpage

Difference Between Bold & Strong Tag:

bold and strong tag dekhne m same hi hn but kaam alag alag krte hn
bold tag sirf text ko bold krta hai without any importance
strong tag text ko bold krta hai with extra importance

Syntax:

    <strong></strong>

Code:

    <p>this is <strong>some content</strong> in my webpage</p>

Italic Tag:

it defines italic text
it is used to make text italic

Syntax:

    <i></i>

Code:

    <p>this is <i>some content</i> in my webpage</p>

Emphasized Tag:

it defines Emphasized text
it is used to make text emphasized

Syntax:

    <em></em>

Code:

    <p>this is <em>some content</em> in my webpage</p>

Difference Between Italic Tag & Emphasized Tag:



Small Tag:

it defines small text
font size of small tag will be smaller than normal text

Syntax:

    <small></small>

Code:

    <p>this is <small>some content</small> in my webpage</p>

Big Tag:

it defines big text
font size of big tag will be larger than normal text

Syntax:

    <big></big>

Code:

    <p>this is <big>some content</big> in my webpage</p>

Superscript Tag:

it defines Superscript text
it is used to write mathematical formula
it makes any characters small and upward from the normal text in the same line
chota kr k oper ki tarf dikhata hai 

Syntax:

    <sup></sup>

Code:

    <p>10<sup>2</sup></p>

Subscript Tag:

it defines Subscript text
it is used to write chemical formula and logarithms etc
it makes any characters small and downward from the normal text in the same line
chota kr k neche ki tarf dikhata hai 

Syntax:

    <sub></sub>

Code:

    <p>10<sub>2</sub></p>

lang attribute:

lang attribute in html tag defines that in which language this html document is written?
html tag k ander jo bhi cheezen hn unki language define krta hai 
the value of lang attribute is "en" means the language of our html document is English 












List:

we use list in our daily life 
jab bhi ham koi samaan lene jaate hn to 1 list tayar kr k le k jaate hn jis k ander bht saare items hote hn 
just like same as in HTML, lists are common in the webpage
we use lists in navigation bar or menu in webpage 
navigation bar or menu on the webpage are created by using list items in html document

List Item Tag:

There is a list item tag in html when we create any type of list 
list item tag is present under the different types of list tags 
we use list item tag to every items of the list  
Each list item is specified by a list item tag 
Each list item can contain single item of the list
means 1 list item tag shows only 1 item of the list 

Syntax:

    <li></li>

Representation:

    <li>list item goes here</li>

Note:   There are many li tags under ol tag 

3 Types of List:

There are 3 types of list in html:

    1. Ordered list
    2. Unordered list
    3. Definition list

Ordered List:

ordered list k name se pta chal rha hai k is list k ander koi order hoga jese alphabetical, numerical order etc.
Ordered list is also called "Numbered List", because bydefault ordered list displays list items in numerical order.

Note:   list item tag <li></li> is present under the ordered list tag 

Syntax:

    <ol>
        <li></li>
    </ol>

Representation:

    <ol>
        <li>list item goes here</li>
    </ol>

Code:

    <ol>
        <li>HTML</li>
        <li>CSS</li>
        <li>JavaScript</li>
    </ol>

When we use Orderd List?

agr hamen list k items ksi bhi order m chahye to ham ordered list ka use kr sakte hn  

5 Types of Ordered List:

There are 5 types of ordered list in html:

    1. Alphabetical order (uppercase "A" & lowercase "a")
    2. Numerical order ("1")
    3. Roman order (uppercase "I" & lowercase "i")

How to change the type of ordered list?

we use type attribute to change the type of ordered list
you can change the order of list items to any order, like below: 

Code:

    <!-- Change the type of ordered list to Capital Alphabetical Order -->
