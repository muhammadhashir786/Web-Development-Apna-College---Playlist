HyperLink:

HyperLink ki wja se web m 1 jaal ban saka hai
agr ham google m koi search krte hn, to hamare pas bht saare results ajate hn, or in results pr ham agr click krte hn to 1 new website open hojati hai, to jis cheez p aapne click kia hai usko HyperLink kehte hn 

we use anchor tag to create a HyperLink in a webpage

Anchor Tag:

Anchor tag defines a link in html document
it is inline element
ksi bhi website m koi bhi link hota hai to vo anchor tag ki madad se hota hai

Syntax:

    <a></a>

3 Attributes of Anchor Tag:

There are 3 attributes of anchor tag:

1. href
2. target
3. title

1. href Attribute:

there is an important attribute in anchor tag which is "href" attribute
href is the attribute where we specified the link of any website 
href k ander ham URL daal sakte hn jis se ham ksi bhi website, file, ya website ka koi section, ya ksi bhi cheez ko ham ko link kr sakte hn 

What is URL?

URL stands for Uniform Resource Locator
agr hamen poore web m koi bhi cheez ki location deni ho to ham URL ka use krte hn
or ye hamare ghr k address ki trah unique hota hai 

URL is also known as the location, path or address or anything in the web   ---------- 

2 Types of URL:

There are 2 types of URL:

    1. Absolute URL
    2. Relative URL

Absolute URL/Path:

start se le k end tak ka jo path hota hai target file ka, usko Absolute URL kehte hn 
ksi bhi cheez ka complete address Absolute URL kehlata hai 

eg:     city k center se aap k ghr ka path Absolute path hota hai

Relative URL/Path:

jahan pr abhi aap present hn vahan se le k aap k ghr ka path Relative path hota hai 
current file se le k (jisme ap code kr rhe hn), targert file tak ka jo path hota hai usko Relative URL kehte hn 

3 Types of Relative URL:

Moving into the File locations in Relative URL:

There are 3 situations of moving into the file locations in Relative URL:

    1. moving into the folder (go to sub-folder) 
    2. files present in the same folder where you code 
    3. moving out of the folder (go to parent folder) 

1. (Moving Out of The Folder) Go to Sub-Folder:

if your target file is present in the sub-folder where you code
in this case just type "folder name" then type "/" then type "file name" with extension in the "href" attribute of anchor tag <a></a>

Syntax:

    <a href="foldername/filename with extension">Content of Anchor Tag</a>

Code:

    <a href="new/main.html">Go to Main</a>

2. Files Present In The Same-folder:

if your target file is present in the same location where you code
in this case just type the file name with extension in "href" attribute of anchor tag

Syntax:

    <a href="filename with extension">Content of Anchor Tag</a>

Code:

    <a href="main.html">Go to Main</a>

3. Moving Out of The Folder (Go To Parent Folder):

if your target file is present out of the folder where you code
in this case just type "../" then type "foldername/filename with extension in href attribute of anchor tag

Syntax:

    <a href="../folderName/filename with extension">Content of Anchor Tag</a>

Code:

    <!-- link of Relative URL (Internal Webpage)

    <a href="../main.html">Go to Main</a>

How to Move Out of more than 1 Folders?

    ../                 go outside from 1 folder
    ../ ../             for 2 folders
    ../ ../ ../         for 3 folders
    ../ ../ ../ ../     for 4 folders

now you can see our link will be open in the existing browser tab

Code:

    <!-- link of Absolute URL (External Webpage)

    <a href="https://www.google.com">Go To Google</a>

    <!-- link of Relative URL (Internal Webpage)

    <a href="main.html" target="_blank">Go To Main</a

2. Target Attribute:

if you want to open linked webpage in a new tab then use the "target" attribute
value of target attribute is "_blank"

Code:

    <!-- link of Absolute URL (External Webpage)

    <a href="https://www.google.com" target="_blank">Go To Google</a>

    <!-- link of Relative URL (Internal Webpage)

    <a href="main.html" target="_blank">Go To Main</a>

Values Of Target Attribute:

there are 4 values of target attribute:

_blank

Practice:

Link of Relative webpages  
Link of Absolute webpages 

Absolute: 

link of google drive where our files or notes are present

syntax:

    <a href="https://......" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Notes In Our Google Drive</a>

Relative:

link of our notes that are present in same location or Relative path:

syntax:

    <a href="filename.pdf" target="_blank">Notes In Same Location</a>
    <a href="Notes/filename.pdf" target="_blank">Notes In Same Location</a>
    <a href="../Notes/filename.pdf" target="_blank">Notes In Same Location</a>

now You understand that how to link any webpage or navigate between webpages by using links anchor tag











Some Points About Frontend & Backend:

jab bhi ham ksi bhi website ko open krte hn to uska jo frontend vala part hota hai to vo hamare browser m display ho jata hai

to agr aap us code ko dekhna chaho jo hamare browser m load huwa hia to us k lye hamare pas 2 options hote hn 

right click on empty area on any webpage 
there are 2 options visible to you 
inspect element and view page source 

View Page Source:

view page source is used to see the frontend source code of any website  
press ctrl + u to open view page source
we can also change frontend code in your browser for temporarily but if we reload the page again the changes will be removed and file will become in original form   

because the original file is saved in the server (database) not our computer's browser
hamare pas vo file to agai hai server se lekin ham kuch bhi change krnge us file m to server p change nhi hoga sirf hamare browser p change hoga or jab ham reload krnge to file apni original form m hojaiegi 

This is how frontend and Backend works

Inspect Element:

inspect element is used to inspect any elements in a webpage
press ctrl + shift + i to open inspect element in a webpage

Features of Inspect Element:

there many options in inspect element:

you can change the html, css and js code for temporarily
you can check the responsiveness of website in different screen sizes
you can also the optimized score of website
you can also click on a particular element and inspect it 

Image Tag:

image tag defines an image in the html document
we use image tag in html document to link any image in the webpage
it is inline element
it is a self-closing tag, it does not have a closing tag
ksi bhi website m koi bhi image display ho rhi hoti hai to vo image tag ki madad se hoti hai


Syntax: 

    <img>

Attributes of Image Tag:

There are 5 attributes of image tag:

    1. src 
    2. alt 
    3. title
    4. height 
    5. width 

1. src Attribute:

we give the image location in the src attribute using URL
there may be Absolute or Relative links of image

Code:

    <!-- Relative Image Link -->

    <img src="images/image.jpg">

for Absolute link, find the image on internet copy the link of that image and paste it in "src" attribute

2. alt Attribute:

alt is the attribute to display the alternate text when your image file does not exist due to some error in server or your have been deleted or give the wrong file location so in this case an alternative text will be display instead of image, so what is that alternate text? you will write this in "alt" attribute.

Code:

    <!-- file location is wrong, alt text will be display -->

    <img src="wrong file location" alt="This is an image"

3. Width Attribute:

we use width attribute to change the width of image
we can specify the size of width in pixels

Code:

    <!-- Relative Image Link -->

    <img src="images/image.jpg" width="350px">

now you will see image in the website, you observe height of image will also change, if you only give the height or width attribute then other attribute will change because it automatically maintains the image ratio

4. Height Attribute:

we use height attribute to change the height of image
we can specify the size of height in pixels

Code:

    <!-- Relative Image Link -->

    <img src="images/image.jpg" height="200px">

if we use height and width both attributes in src attribute, then aspect ratio of the image will be bigar jaiega

Code:

    <!-- Relative Image Link -->

    <img src="images/image.jpg" width="350px" height="200px">

to maintain the aspect ratio of the image, use anyone 1 attribute only

Code:

    <!-- Relative Video Link -->

    <img src="video/video.mp4" controls>

so why did we give control attribute in video tag?

5. autoplay Attribute:

if we want to autoplay video in our website so we can use autoplay attribute in video tag
this attribute does not have buttons to show
if a user come to your website then video will be play automatically
there will no buttons in video to pause and control volumes of this video 

Code:

    <!-- Relative Video Link -->

    <img src="video/video.mp4" autoplay>

Code:

    <!-- Relative Video Link -->

    <img src="video/video.mp4" muted>

8. poster Attribute:

Poster attribute defines a thumbnail for your video like youtube videos
if we apply thumbnail in the video of our website then we use poster attribute

    <!-- Relative Video Link -->

    <img src="video/video.mp4" poster="images/image.jpg">

Table Structure:

we can create a table structure by using some tags

there are 3 tags that makes a table structure:

    1. thead Tag
    2. tbody Tag
    3. tfoot Tag

Jab ham table banate hn to sab se oper ham table header banate hn jisme first row k ander bht saare columns hote hn ham har 1 column k lye heading likhte hn <th></th> ki help se or hamare table ka jo bhi data/content hota hai vo ham <td></td> tag ki help se likhte hn table tag k ander.

so <th></th> and <td></td> tags are divided into 2 parts with <thead></thead> and <tbody></tbody> tags

These tags do not make changes in User Interface 
it only makes the structure of table

1. Thead Tag:

thead tag is called Table Head 
it is the head of the table
it is the upper part of the table that includes main heading of table and no of columns that are present in the 1st row of table
it contains table caption, table row <tr></tr> & table header <th></th> tags

Syntax:

    <thead></thead>

Code:

    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Month</th>
                <th>Saving</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
    </table>


2. Tbody Tag:

tbody tag is called Table Body 
it is the body of the table
it is the main part of the table that includes all the contents of table with many rows and columns
it contains table rows <tr></tr> & table data <td></td> tags

Syntax:

    <tbody></tbody>

Code:

    <table>
        <body>
            <tr>
                <td>January</td>
                <td>$100</td>
            </tr>
        </body>
    </table>

3. Tfoot Tag:

tfoot tag is called Table Footer
it is the footer of the table
it is the ending or last part of the table that includes result/conclusion/summary of the table and no of columns that are present in the last row of table
it contains table row <tr></tr>, table data <td></td> & or table header <th></th> tags

Syntax:

    <tfoot></tfoot>

Code:

    if we create a marksheet table and if we need sum of all the marks then we use tfoot tag in the last of the table:

    <table>
        <tfoot>
            <tr>
                <th>Total Marks: 850</th>
            </tr>
        </tfoot>
    </table> 

Table Caption Left

A Complete Table Structure With Table Head & Body:

Code:

                <td>20</td>
                <td>88</td>
                <td>A</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Chemistry</td>
                <td>73</td>
                <td>22</td>
                <td>95</td>
                <td>A+</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
        <tfoot>
            <th colspan="5">Result: Pass</th>
        </tfoot>
    </table>

Code:

    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Month</th>
